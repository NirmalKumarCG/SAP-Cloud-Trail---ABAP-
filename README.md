```This is procedural method to create CDS views for your table/tables to implement them as FIORI/UI5 Applications using Eclipse ADT tools.```

### Steps to Create - 
1.Creating a Ztable.
2.Create an CDS view for the Ztable with associations.
3.Adding UI Annotations to the CDS view.
4.Implement Service Definiton (exposing your cds view and associations to the definition).
5.Defining a Behaviour Definition (to use CRUD operations - create, read, update and delete actions in application). 
6.Implementing a Behaviour Implementation (Managed / Unmanaged -I will be skipping this Step because this might vary depending on the business logic).
7.Creating a Service Binding for the definition using OData protocols (ui-v2 , ui-v4).
8.Activate the Service Entity and Preivew the Fiori Application by selecting the node under the service details tab.
